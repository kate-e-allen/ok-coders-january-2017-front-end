## Basic Javascript Exercise

As we know, living in Oklahoma, the weather can be very unpredictable! It almost feels...random...as if we could somehow just flip a coin (or use a random number generator) to predict the weather. Today, we're going to create a program to predict the weather conditions and to give people suggestions of what activities they can do in each weather situation.

Today, we're predicting the chance of precipitation and the temperature. Write a Javascript program that generates a random number for both the chance of precipitation and the temperature, and then use a series of conditional statements to inform the people what they can do. Use your basic understanding of weather to help you out.

For example, let's say the temperature is 80°F and the chance of precipitation is 0%. This means it's a great day for the beach! However, if the temperature were to be 23°F and chance of precipitation 90%, we'd probably guess that we're going to have a snow day, and it's a great day to go play in the snow! 

#####There are 5 different activities we want to classify:
	<li> Go play in the snow!
	<li> Get out those rain boots!
	<li> Perfect time for some hot chocolate by the fireplace!
	<li> Beach day!
	<li> Normal, boring day. Go to work.

#####To help you out, here are some Javascript functions that will help you get started:

	- Random number generator (generates decimal between 0 and 1)
	
		Math.random()

		e.g. Math.random() --> 0.321233424

	- Round a decimal number into a nice integer

		Math.round(x)

		e.g. Math.random(32.1233424) --> 32

Don't forget your conditional statements!

###Good luck!
